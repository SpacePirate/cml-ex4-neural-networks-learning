# Exercise 4: Neural Networks Learning
In this exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. Before
starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the
video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.
<br />
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter
code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the
exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to
this directory before starting this exercise.
<br />
You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the \En-
vironment Setup Instructions" of the course website.
